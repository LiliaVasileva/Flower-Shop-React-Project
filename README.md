# Flower-Shop-React-Project
Final project in order to graduate as a full stack developer from SoftUni academy.

Flower-Shop-React is a full stack custom app, written with React, Express, Node.js.
All styles are custom made, and owned by owner of the repo.
It aims to provide information about flower items to users.
It has three main categories - funeral items, wedding items and assortment items.
Every item has detail page where owner can edit and delete content. 
If not the owner is visiting the detail page he/she does not have access to CRUD operations, only to view the item info.

Client is using React to render all pages and components of the pages.
Every page is separated by multiple components.
For sending request to the server is used fetch api.
The context is managed by providers who give access to every component to the state and other useful hooks.
